# Spellchecker

## Getting started

You'll need an LTS version of Node (v18 at this time). Once Node is installed,
run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Other useful commands:

- `npm run format`, run code formatter.
- `npm run lint`, run code linter.
- `npm run sample`, sample run spellx checcing this file.
